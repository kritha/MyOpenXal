Database Browser is a convenient application for quickly browsing a database.  When the application is launched the user's default database connection dicionary is fetched and the application attempts to use it to connect to the database.  If the conneciton fails, the user is shown a dialog box and asked to supply connection information.  The user can always connect to the database using their account by pressing the "connect" button in the toolbar.

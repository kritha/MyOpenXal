<h1>The Online Model</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Here we list some general notes and descriptions of the online model operation.
The procedure for running simulations is well documented in many other sources,
including the <a href="http://xaldev.sourceforge.net/">official Open XAL web site</a> 
and the <a href="https://ess-ics.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SCA/OpenXAL">ESS Open XAL web site</a>.
</p>
<h2>Running Simulations</h2>
<h4>Scenarios</h4>
<p>
To simulate a section of beamline, one first needs to create an online model object for
that beamline.  This object is of type <code>xal.sim.Scenario</code>.  The scenario object
is instantiated for a particular <code>AcceleratorSeq</code> object representing the 
section of beamline to be simulated.
</p>
<h4>Probes</h4>
<p>
The type of simulation is determined by the type of <i>probe</i> object used in the
simulation; that is, provided to the scenario object.  For example, to simulate a
single particle, or beam centroid, a probe of type 
<code>xal.model.probe.ParticleProbe</code> is used.  For an envelope simulation an
<code>xal.model.probe.EnvelopeProbe</code> object would be instantiated.  To create
these probes a factory class exists, <code>xal.sim.scenario.ProbeFactory</code>.
However, an <i>algorithm</i> object must first be created before a probe can be
instantiated with the factory (see below).  
</p>
<h4>Synchronization</h4>
<p>
Once the algorithm, probe, and scenario are created, before the simulation can be run
a synchronization scheme must be chosen.  This is done with the method 
<code>Scenario.setSynchronizationMode()</code>.  Listed below are the possible arguments
for this method and their result.
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SYNC_MODE_LIVE - synchronizes the beamline model parameters to the live machine values
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SYNC_MODE_DESIGN - set the beamline model parameters to the machine design values
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SYNC_MODE_RF_DESIGN - the RF parameters are set to design, all others are live values
<br/>
<br/>
There is one other option.  The <code>PVLogger</code> service can be used to retrieve historical
machine states and align all the model parameters to these values.  The class that performs this
function is <code>xal.service.pvlogger.sim</code>.
</p>
<h4>Simulation Process</h4>
<p>
Simulation results are saved as <i>probe states</i> in a <i>trajectory</i> object.  That is,
depending upon the type of simulation (particle, envelope, transfer map, etc.), the results are
encapsulated by objects derived from the base class <code>ProbeState</code> and aggregated
in the ordered <code>Trajectory</code> object. Here we cover the way the online model saves 
probe states.  
</p>
<p>
The following is what happens when you run a scenario:
</p>
<table>
  <tr> 
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
      &middot; If a starting element is specified the online model saves the initializing probe 
      state as the first state in the trajectory.  
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
     <td>
        &middot; When the starting element is reached the next probe state to be saved depends
        upon the values of the <code>probeUpdatePolicy</code> attribute of the algorithm
        object (see below).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
      &middot; The online model then transports the probe through
      the model lattice with the initial state intact until it reaches the starting element.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        &middot; Once the start element is reached the online model begins propagation the probe through
        the beamline until it reaches either the
        stopping element if one is specified, or the end of the sequence if no stopping element
        is specified.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        &middot; The dynamics of the probe propagation depend upon both the type of the probe
        (e.g., particle, envelope, transfer map, etc.) the algorithm provided to, and maintained by, 
        the probe.  
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that a single probe type may have many different methods of propagation, for example,
an <code>EnvelopeProbe</code> may have an <code>EnvelopeTracker</code>, 
<code>EnvelopeBackTracker</code>, <code>EnvTrackerAdapt</code>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Dynamics</h4>
<p>
The dynamics of the simulation are contained in the <code>algorithm</code>
component of the online model.  Algorithms classes are derived from the base
class <code>xal.model.alg.Tracker</code>, which contains the boiler plate functionality
for any algorithm.  Algorithms understand how to propagate specific probe types
through the model beamline.  They are implementations of specific dynamics.  Since there
may be many different ways to model the dynamics of a beam aspect there can be many 
different algorithms for the same probe type.  Thus, it is necessary to provide
each probe a specific algorithm object.  There is an algorithm factory, 
<code>xal.sim.scenario.AlgorithmFactory</code>, for creating algorithms.
</p>

<h2>Simulation Results</h2>
<p>
The results of an online model simulation are contained in a <code>Trajectory</code>
object maintained by the probe.  The trajectory is an ordered aggregation of 
<code>ProbeState</code>-derived objects.  They contain the state of the probe
at specified instances along the beamline (see below).  The attributes of the 
state are particular to the type of probe being simulated.
</p>
<h4>The Probe Update Policy</h4> 
<p>
Each probe maintains an algorithm object, as mentioned above. The value of 
the<code>probeUpdatePolicy</code> attribute in this algorithm object determines
the way the simulation results (i.e., "probe states") are stored in the trajectory.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>Tracker.UPDATE_ENTRANCE</code> &middot; the probe state is saved to the trajectory then the probe is propagated through the element
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>Tracker.UPDATE_EXIT</code> &middot; the probe is propagated through the element then its state saved to the trajectory
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>Tracker.UPDATE_ALWAYS</code> &middot; the probe state is saved every time the probe is moved (e.g., after a space charge kick), but only when moved.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
    </td>
    <td>
        <code>Tracker.UPDATE_ENTRANCEANDEXIT</code> &middot; the probe state is saved to the the trajectory, the probe is propagated through the element, then again saved 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The default value is <code>Tracker.UPDATE_EXIT</code>.
</p>
<p>
The above behaviors are essentially the same when you do not have a starting element specified.
Here there is usually a marker node at the beginning of any sequence and the state
of a marker is the same irrelevant of exit or entrance.
Choice of the <i>probeUpdatePolicy</i> depends upon where you need the probe states (see below).
</p>
<p>
There can be multiple modeling elements that map to the same hardware node.  
Plus there can be multiple probe states that map to the same modeling element (especially so with space charge).  
When you ask the trajectory object for the states of a hardware node you will 
get all of them.  The convenience method 
<code>Trajectory#statesForElement(String) : ProbeState[].  The method Trajectory#stateForElement(String) : ProbeState </code>
just returns the first one.
</p>
<h4>Retrieving the First State</h4>
<p>
If you require that the initial state of the start element be in the trajectory the following 
are are a couple options:
<br/>
<br/>
&middot; You can set the <code>Tracker#setProbeUpdatePolicy()</code> to <code>Tracker.UPDATE_ENTRANCEANDEXIT</code>.  
Then both the entrance and exit states of every element between the start element and the stop element will
be in the trajectory.
<br/>
&middot; You can set the <code>Probe#setCurrentElementId()</code> to the ID of the start element.  
Thus, when the propagation is initiated, the initial state of the probe is saved to the trajectory with the ID 
of the start element, and will be returned with a call to 
<code>Trajectory#statesForElement(String)</code>.
</p>
 
<p>
<h2>Processing Simulation Results</h2>
There are a variety of tools for processing the simulation results of the online model.  
In particular there is a suite of tools in the <code>xal.tools.beam.calc</code> package that
performs direct calculations on the <code>Trajectory</code> objects produced in the simulation.
The calculations depend upon the type of the <code>ProbeState</code> objects contained in
the trajectory.  For example, the class <code>CalculationsOnMachines</code> expects  
<code>TransferMapState</code> objects since such states are completely determined by the
beamline, and not any beam.  The components of <code>xal.tools.beam.calc</code> are
well documented and we refer the reader to the Javadoc for this package.
</p>
<h2>New Acceleration Model</h2>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>Currently the acceleration model of the online model is being upgraded.  This action
includes modification of the lattice generator, addition of nested modeling elements analogous
to the nested hardware objects of the SMF hierarchy, addition of longitudinal phase variables,
addition of a RF cavity, and a complete refactoring of the RF gap element.  The old modeling 
element <code>IdealRfGap</code> was replaced with the new implementation
<code>SpectralMapRfGap</code>.  There are two
new and very important classes in the refactoring, AxialFieldSpectrum representing the
axial RF field spectrum and related quantities, and AcceleratingRfGap which handles all the
dynamics calculations of the RF gap.  It was necessary to alter these two classes in order
to emulate the previous acceleration dynamics.  These modifications are listed below and must
be converted back in order to utilize the full acceleration model.  
</p>
<p>
As of November, 2015 the new RF acceleration model has been configured to emulate the
previous acceleration model. To utilize all the features of the new model the following
issues are identified:
</p>
<p>
<b><code>AxialFieldSpectrum</code></b>
<ul>
<li>Private method <code>dkTzfromDkTz0(double)</code> used for backward compatibility must be switched
to use <tt>magic number</tt> implementation.
<li>Private method <code>dkTzfromDkTz0(double)</code> used for backward compatibility must be switched
to use <tt>magic number</tt> implementation.
<li>Private method <code>dkTqFromDkSq0(double></code> used for backward compatibility must be switched
to use <tt>magic number</tt> implementation.
<li>Private method <code>dkSqFromDkSq0(double></code> used for backward compatibility must be switched
to use <tt>magic number</tt> implementation.
</UL>
<p/>
<p>
<b><code>AcceleratingRfGap</code></b>
<ul>
No changes necessary at this time.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b><code>SpectrumMapRfGap</code></b>
<ul>
<li>Private method <code>compGapPhaseAndEnergyGainIndirect(IProbe)</code> has multiple issues. There
are many type outs to be removed as necessary.  The old method computes the "mid-gap wave number"
then the phase and energy gains from that value.  The new method computes the gap gains directly
for the upstream (pre-gap) and downstream (post-gap) regions then sums them for the full values.
There are <code>TODO</code> comments marking the necessary changes.  Look for the local variables
<code>DELTA_PHASE_CORRECTION</code> and <code>theEnergyGain</code>.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>New Spectral Quantities</h3>
The new acceleration model also requires new spectral quantities other than the conventional 
transit time factors <i>T</i>(<i>k</i>) and <i>S</i>(<i>k</i>).  They are termed the
<i>quadrature transit time factors</i> <i>T<sub>q</sub></i>(<i>k</i>) and 
<i>S<sub>q</sub></i>(<i>k</i>).  The additional quantities can
be provided using an "optics_extra" file if they are not available in the XDXF file.  These
quantities must be computed off line in a similar fashion as are the conventional transit time
factors.  For a complete set of RF cavity field spectral quantities the online model requires
<i>T</i>(<i>k</i>), <i>S</i>(<i>k</i>), <i>T<sub>q</sub></i>(<i>k</i>), <i>S<sub>q</sub></i>(<i>k</i>),
and their derivatives.  Polynomial approximations are used for all.

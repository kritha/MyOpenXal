/**

 * 
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes representing linear algebraic objects and also provides
 * tools for performing standard operations on these objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At current it is a place holder, the linear algebra classes are now spread amongst
 * several sibling packages <code>r2, r3, r4</code>, etc. and also in the parent class
 * <code>xal.tools.math</code>.  It is my intent to consolidate these classes here at
 * a later date when it can be done under consensus.

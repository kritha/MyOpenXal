<div>
Trip Viewer allows the user to view trip events that have been recorded to the database.  Note that trip records are posted to the database every half hour so, <b>the trip records that may be seen using this tool may be as much as a half hour old</b> (assuming there are no problems with the database).
</div>

<br>
<div>
Begin by selecting a time range between which to fetch the trip records.  Press the "Fetch" button.  You may be requested to provide database connection information (note that if you want to change the database connection criteria, you can do so by pressing the "Connect..." button).
</div>

<br>
<div>
You may sort the trip records by pressing either the "Time" or the "PV" radio button.  "Time" sorting displays the trip records sorted by time stamp.  "PV" sorting displays the trip records sorted first by PV and then by time.
</div>

<br>
<div>
You may filter which records are displayed in the table by selecting one or more PV filter and/or one or more node key.  Note that the node keys listed are only the ones that were found among all the trip records fetched for the specified time period.  Making no selection in either list implies no filtering.

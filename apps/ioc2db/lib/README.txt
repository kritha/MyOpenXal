JCIFS is an Open Source client library that implements the CIFS/SMB networking protocol in 
100% Java. CIFS is the standard file sharing protocol on the Microsoft Windows platform 
(e.g. Map Network Drive ...). This client is used extensively in production on large Intranets. 
The jcifs.x.x.x.jar file contains the Java bytecode implementation of the library.

The latest JCIFS jar file is available for download at the https://jcifs.samba.org/ website.
